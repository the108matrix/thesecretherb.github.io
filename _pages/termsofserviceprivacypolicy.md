### Copyright Notice

The content on this website is protected under the United States Copyright Act of 1976 and other applicable laws. All rights are reserved. Unauthorized reproduction or redistribution of the content on this website is strictly prohibited without written permission from The Secret Herb.

## Privacy Policy
### Our Commitment To Privacy

The Secret Herb values your privacy. We are committed to leveraging the power of internet technology to provide you with an interactive and personalized experience while ensuring your privacy. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party.

### How We Collect Information

Information may be gathered through automatic data collection tools as well as through voluntary submission by users. This includes but is not limited to, contact information, IP address, browser type, and operating system.

For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site.

As we adopt additional technology, we also may gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according to your preferences.

### Types of Information Collected

Some data will be collected automatically by Our Site to enhance your user experience. For further details, please see section below on Our use of Cookies. Other data will only be collected if you voluntarily submit it and consent to Us using it, for example, when signing up for our mailing list.

Depending upon your use of Our Site, we may collect some or all of the following data:

- Full name
- Contact information such as email addresses and telephone numbers
- IP address (automatically collected)
- Web browser type and version (automatically collected)
- Operating system (automatically collected)
- A list of URLs starting with a referring site, your activity on Our Site, and the site you exit to (automatically collected)
- Data Storage And Transfer

Some or all of your data may be stored or transferred outside of the European Economic Area (“the EEA”) (The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). You are deemed to accept and agree to this by using Our Site and submitting information to Us.

If we do store or transfer data outside the EEA, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated as safely and securely as it would be within the EEA and under the GDPR. Such steps may include, but not be limited to, the use of legally binding contractual terms between Us and any third parties We engage and the use of the EU-approved Model Contractual Arrangements

We only store your data for as long as we need to in order to use it as described above, and/or for as long as we have your permission to keep it.

### Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or to comply with our legal obligations.

### Use of Information

Information collected is used to improve site functionality, deliver personalized content, manage user accounts, process transactions, and comply with legal obligations.

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.

We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on this site to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by this site and other topics we think you might find of interest. Personally Identifiable Information collected by this site also may be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of ecommerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law.

In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
